Let a positive integer n be supplied by the user. Write a program that will output the number of nprimes less than n.

An nprime is a prime whose greatest common divisor (gcd) with n is equal to 1.

For example the number of nprimes for n=9 is 3 because there are three primes, i.e., (2, 5, 7), less than 9 whose gcd with 9 is equal to 1.

Your program should be able to handle integers in the range 0 < n < 100.
